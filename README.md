# Deep-Neural-Networks
Working through, with and understanding several algorithms to accomplish tasks.

The nature of Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning are such that although they aren't 'correlated' (linearly dependent), if we assume (absurd? maybe) each of the learning domain to be a probabilitic space; although they are 'Uncorrelated', they aren't Independent.
